            Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the
            way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means
            of marking  up  the  structure  of  a  document  not  as  a  way  of  determining  its  presentation.

            Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear<br/><br/>
            in a printed document.<br/>

            <a href="filethree.html"><img src="babyTurtle.jpg" alt="Baby turtles making their way to the sea."

            <p>
                Baby Sea Turtles are cute. I don't like how in Activity 5 it says to make the height and width
                equal to 50. Why can't we resize to what we see fitting?
